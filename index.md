# Hello!

I'm Efua, a junior at Wellesley College majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Philosophy. I am also a cross-registered student at MIT. I'm excited about a variety of topics, particularly machine learning, data science, and human-computer interaction.

My most recent work was on the GroundTruth project - an NSF-REU within Virginia Tech's Crowd Lab - involving tessting new features for expert-led crowdsourced geolocation and data analysis of crowdsourced geolocation quizzes. I will also be presenting with the team at HCOMP in October of 2019. Previously, I've worked on projects related to data science, user interface, and general software development. Outside of technology, I love art, reading, and learning languages.
